# ACN-Sim Case Study

To demonstrate the usefulness of ACN-Sim we present a simple case study. In this study, we implement an earliest deadline first algorithm which respects three-phase infrastructure constraints. We then compare line currents for each phase in the network with those resulting from uncontrolled charging.

## Try it.
You can try this experiment online without needing to install anything on your local machine using Google Colab.

You will likely see a message "Warning: This notebook was not authored by Google." Click "Run Anyway". If you feel more comfortable, you can reset your runtimes, if other Colab notebooks have access to your private data. **This script does not attempt to access any of your data.**
