# ACN-Sim Case Study

To demonstrate the usefulness of ACN-Sim we present a simple case study. In this study, we implement an earliest deadline first algorithm which respects three-phase infrastructure constraints. We then compare line currents for each phase in the network with those resulting from uncontrolled charging.
